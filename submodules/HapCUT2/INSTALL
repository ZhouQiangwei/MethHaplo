REQUIREMENTS
=============

HapCUT is written in C and requires a gcc like compiler to compile the source code. The automated build system uses GNU Make. HapCUT also requires the SAMtools package (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) to read BAM files. If you do not already have SAMtools, running 'make' will automatically download and compile it for you before doing anything else.

If you already have SAMtools 0.1.18, you can optionally modify the top of the Makefile in the source directory to point to your SAMtools directory prior to running 'make'.

HOW TO COMPILE THE CODE

========================

Run 'make' in the project master directory.


HOW TO INSTALL THE PROGRAMS

========================

Run 'sudo make install' after compiling the code.
